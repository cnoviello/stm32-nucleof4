# STM32Nucleo-F4 UART example
This example project shows how to integrated virtual COM port of the STM32Nucleo board. It was generated in Eclipse using [GNU ARM Eclipse](http://gnuarmeclipse.livius.net/blog/) by Liviu Ionescu. If you need to setup the whole Eclipse/GCC ARM tool-chain, you can follow [this series](http://www.carminenoviello.com/en/2014/12/28/setting-gcceclipse-toolchain-stm32nucleo-part-1/) made of three parts on my blog.
I wrote a tutorial on [my blog](http://www.carminenoviello.com/en/2015/03/02/how-to-use-stm32-nucleo-serial-port/) about how to use the integrated Nucleo virtual COM port.
**The example is preconfigured to work with Nucleo-F401RE and Nucleo-F411RE boards.**
